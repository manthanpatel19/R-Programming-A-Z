This repository contains projects for Udemy's [R Programming A-Z: R For Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-programming/) course taught by Kirill Eremenko

### Section 1: Hit The Ground Running
>In this section, we get started by an introduction to R and also install R & R studio. We also look at a basic example to get started.

### Section 2: Core Programming Principles
>In this section, we see the basic principles of programming and practice it in the R language.

### Section 3: Fundamentals of R
>In this section, we work with the fundamental building blocks of R such as vectors, usage of square brackets, functions and packages in R.

### Section 4: Matrices
>In this section, we dive deep into what are matrices and work on creating matrices, perform operations on matrices, visualizing subsets, etc.

### Section 5: Data Frames
>In this section, we see what are dataframes in R and compare them to matrices. We then see how to build dataframes by importing data, explore data and also how to subset, merge and visualize the data using qplot.

### Section 6: Advanced Visualization with GGPlot2
>In this section, we see what is the grammar of graphics and work on various plotting techniques using a library in R called GGPlot2.
